# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like Age, Sex, Class, and Fare. It serves as a foundational project for binary classification.

## Files
1.  **`titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb`** (or similar notebook file)
    *   **Purpose**: Complete analysis pipeline.
    *   **Content**:
        *   **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values (e.g., Age imputation).
        *   **EDA**: Analyzing survival rates by gender, class, etc.
        *   **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features like 'FamilySize'.
        *   **Model Training**: Implementing Logistic Regression (and potentially others like Random Forest).
        *   **Evaluation**: Checking Accuracy and Confusion Matrix.

## How to Run
1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Open the Notebook**:
    Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook and open the .ipynb file to run the cells.
